# Using OpenID Connect to authenticate a person in Java

The [http://openid.net/connect](OpenID Connect) Protocol offers Java developers a way to authenticate a person at any Internet domain that supports the standard. To accomplish this, the domain must provide a way to register clients--the website and mobile applications that use the authentication API offered by the domain.

## Discovery

Discovery is the first step! Luckily, its super-easy! All you have to 
do is make a get request to `https://{domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration`

This will return a JSON object, as described in the [specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html). For example, you can see Gluu's OpenID Connect discovery [url](https://idp.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration).

This will tell you everything you need to know about this OpenID Connect provider, like what are the endpoints (URLs), what crypto is supported, and what user claims can you ask for.

## Client Registration

In SAML, the website was called a "Service Provider." In OpenID Connect, the website (or mobile application) is called a "Client." Clients can be registered manually by the OP, but more frequently, clients use the [Dynamic Registration API](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) to automate the process. 

## Obtaining the id_token 

After your client is registered, it is time to get down to business. OpenID Connect offers two common workflows for authentication: basic (where the person is using a browser, and can be re-directed) and implicit where the client sends the credentials, including the secret. There is a userful implements guide for [basic](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html) and [implicit](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-implicit-1_0.html)

## Logout 

OpenID Connect defines a mechanism for [Session Management](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html). The idea is that javascript in a web tab can detect that another tab has logged out. One detection of a logout event, the Web application can cleanup sessions in any backend systems as necessary. Its not 100% effective. If the tab is closed when the logout occurs in another tab, the event may not be detected, and the backend systems are advised to timeout sessions.
